This version emphasizes:

* Professional tone suitable for recruiters or employers
* Clear structure with sections for technologies, projects, and contact
* Highlight of key projects with technologies and features

If you want, I can also **add a “Summary & Skills” section at the top** to make it recruiter-ready and even stronger. Do you want me to do that?
